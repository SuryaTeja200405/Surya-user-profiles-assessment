🌈 UI & Design Inspiration
The layout is designed based on Figma mockups provided for this assessment. Every component, color, and typography is closely aligned with the original Figma design for perfect pixel-level precision.

🎨 "The goal is not just to build a UI — but to craft a delightful user experience."

💡 Future Enhancements
🔁 CRUD Functionality – Add Create, Update, Delete options for profiles.

📊 User Analytics Dashboard – Visualize user data using charts and graphs.

🧠 Developer Notes
Keep components modular — one function per component.

Use semantic HTML and accessibility best practices.

Optimize performance using React hooks and lazy loading.

Tailwind tip: Extract reusable styles using @apply and custom config.
